          Hello there! My name is Lloyd Semblante, a 19-year-old residing in the
          vibrant city of Iligan in the beautiful Philippines. I am a passionate
          individual who finds joy in various activities. Coding has become an
          integral part of my life, allowing me to explore my creativity and
          problem-solving skills. When I'm not immersed in the world of
          programming, you can often find me lost in the enchanting melodies of
          music, whether it's playing an instrument or simply enjoying my
          favorite tunes. Gaming is another realm I delve into, where I can
          embark on thrilling adventures and connect with friends across virtual
          landscapes. Life is an exciting journey, and I eagerly embrace every
          opportunity to learn and grow in these passions.
